# Text Editor PWA

Project Repo: [Github-repo](https://github.com/timothymichaelcook/19_text_editor_pwa)

## Description

The focus of this project was to create a web text editor where the user can create text based notes. The user is able to save these notes and access these notes either online or through a local application. The integrated service worker and Cache API's ensure that the application will remain fully functional even without an internet connection.

## User Story

```
- AS A developer
- I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
- SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Installation 

Packages:
Express
Babel
Webpack
CSS-loader
IndexedDB
If-Env

Commands:
mysql -u root -p
source schema.sql
source seeds.sql
npm i
node index.js

## Usage

Users need to import the following npm packages: express, mysql, and console table. Run npm i to install these packages. Users need to enter the database and source the schema and seeds files. Once seeded, the user needs to be in the root directory of the project and run node index.js to start the application.
